**How it works:** The website shows the apartments on sale and rent on the initial page and customers can click on the details to see the number of beds, baths and area of the property, also they can search for properties according to price ranges for example between SEK 100,000 - 400,000 or SEK 500,000 - 1,000,000 etc. In future l'll add features where customers will be able to search for properties by area, city or region.
